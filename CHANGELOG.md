## [12.0.0] - 2025-10-14 (In Progress)

### Added - V12 Meta-ACE Improvements
- **Meta-ACE Cycle 1**: Improved Curator (A → A+) then generated V12 improvements
- **Enhanced Reflector**: Now outputs ALL issues (not just examples) for validation testing
- **Automated Validation Gates**: Test 30-50 issues before full extraction (95% confidence)
- **V12 extraction prompts**: Prevent vague entities, possessive pronouns at source
- **V12 evaluation prompts**: Entity quality checks, philosophical detection
- **Enhanced pronoun resolution** (V1.5.0): Possessive pronouns support
- **Enhanced predicate normalization** (V1.3.0): "is-X-for" patterns, absolute moderation
- **NEW GenericIsAFilter**: Filters metaphorical/generic is-a relationships
- **Expanded praise quote detection**: More comprehensive pattern matching

### Changed - Meta-ACE System
- **Curator improvements**: Fixed path resolution, filesystem scanner (36/40 → 39/40)
- **Applicator enhancements**: Smart path resolution for project-root vs playbook paths
- **Automated changeset application**: All 10/10 V12 changes applied successfully

### Target
- **Quality goal**: <4.5% error rate (A- grade, ~40 issues vs V11.2.2's 70)
- **Time savings**: 5 min validation tests vs 40 min full extraction

### Status
- ⚠️ **Pass 2 failure**: Missing 'candidate_uid' field in Pydantic model (needs fix)
- Pass 1 successful: 793 relationships extracted
- Pass 2.5 ready: All modules enhanced

## [11.2.2] - 2025-10-14

### Added - Validated Baseline
- **First validated ACE baseline**: 7.86% error rate (B+ grade)
- **Comprehensive Reflector analysis**: 70 issues identified across 8 categories
- **Meta-ACE documentation**: Complete framework for improving improvement agents

### Results
- **Total relationships**: 891 extracted
- **Issues identified**: 70 (7.86% error rate)
- **Issue breakdown**:
  - CRITICAL: 0 ✅
  - HIGH: 8 (possessive pronouns, vague entities)
  - MEDIUM: 47 (praise quotes, philosophical claims, predicate fragmentation)
  - MILD: 15 (generic is-a, demonstrative pronouns)
- **Grade**: B+ (production-ready)
- **Attribution**: 100%

### Issues Identified for V12
1. Possessive pronouns as sources ("my people" → should be "Slovenians")
2. Vague abstract entities ("the answer", "easy steps")
3. Praise quote misclassification (endorsements as factual claims)
4. Philosophical statements as facts
5. Predicate fragmentation (125 unique predicates, target ~80)
6. Malformed dedications
7. Overly generic is-a relationships
8. Demonstrative pronoun targets

## [11.2.1] - 2025-10-13

## üìñ TEXT TO EXTRACT FROM

{text}

## ‚ö° BE COMPREHENSIVE, SPECIFIC, AND ACCURATE

Extract relationships that are:
- ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE**: Extract ALL valuable factual relationships (bibliographic, categorical, compositional, functional, organizational)
- ‚úÖ **SPECIFIC**: Avoid vague entities ("thousands" ‚Üí "thousands of people", "the land" ‚Üí "agricultural land")
- ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**: Clearly stated or strongly implied in the text
- ‚úÖ **MEANINGFUL**: Useful for building a complete general knowledge graph (not just discourse graph)
- ‚úÖ **CONCISE**: Use 2-5 word entities when possible

**PRIORITY**: Bibliographic citations, categorical definitions, compositional relationships, functional relationships, and organizational affiliations are HIGH VALUE. Extract ALL of them.

**QUALITY TIPS**:
- Resolve pronouns to specific entities when context allows
- Be specific with determiners and quantifiers ("the land" ‚Üí "agricultural land")
- Extract ALL types of statements - classification happens in Pass 2
- When in doubt, extract it - we prefer completeness over filtering
- Bibliographic citations are NOT "too simple" - they are ESSENTIAL knowledge graph elements

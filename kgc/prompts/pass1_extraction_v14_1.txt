# Extract ALL meaningful relationships from this text - including factual, bibliographic, categorical, compositional, functional, organizational, and testable claims.

## üéØ V11 GOAL: COMPREHENSIVE KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION WITH PROPER LABELING

Extract ALL valuable data, information, knowledge, and wisdom that can be represented in graph/RDF format. This includes:
- ‚úÖ Factual relationships (authorship, publication, organizational)
- ‚úÖ Bibliographic citations (author-book, book-publisher, book-year)
- ‚úÖ Categorical relationships (is-a, is, definitions)
- ‚úÖ Compositional relationships (contains, includes, provides)
- ‚úÖ Functional relationships (produces, enhances, stimulates)
- ‚úÖ Testable claims (scientific assertions)
- ‚úÖ **NEW V11**: Philosophical statements (will be labeled as PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM in Pass 2)
- ‚úÖ **NEW V11**: Metaphorical language (will be labeled as METAPHOR in Pass 2 and normalized by postprocessing)
- ‚úÖ **NEW V11**: Normative prescriptions (will be labeled appropriately)

**V11 LABELING APPROACH**: Extract ALL relationships. Pass 2 evaluation will add classification_flags (FACTUAL, METAPHOR, PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM, etc.), and Pass 2.5 postprocessing modules will normalize/label as appropriate.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ENTITY QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

### Specificity (CRITICAL)
‚ùå **AVOID VAGUE ENTITIES**:
- "thousands" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "thousands of people"
- "millions" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "millions of humans"
- "the land" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "agricultural land" or "Slovenia" (be specific)
- "the sea" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "ocean ecosystems" or "Mediterranean Sea" (be specific)
- "it" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Resolve to specific entity from context
- "they" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Resolve to specific group from context

### Conciseness
‚úÖ **KEEP ENTITIES CONCISE** (2-5 words typically):
- ‚úÖ GOOD: "soil ecosystem complexity"
- ‚ùå BAD: "hardly anything is as complex as the living web of interconnectedness found in our planet's soil"

### Pronoun Resolution
‚úÖ **RESOLVE PRONOUNS** when context allows:
- "I hail from Slovenia. My people love the land."
  - ‚úÖ BETTER: (Aaron William Perry, hails from, Slovenia)
  - ‚úÖ BETTER: (Slovenians, love, agricultural land)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCEPTABLE IF UNCLEAR: (my people, love, the land) [will be flagged]

### Entity Specificity Principle
Always prefer SPECIFIC, CONTEXTUALIZED entities over GENERIC ones. Use document context (geographic setting, domain, author background) to add precision.

**Examples of Specific vs. Generic Entities**:
- ‚úÖ "Slovenian countryside" > ‚ùå "the land"
- ‚úÖ "atmospheric carbon dioxide" > ‚ùå "carbon"
- ‚úÖ "regenerative agriculture practices" > ‚ùå "farming"
- ‚úÖ "Bill Mollison's permaculture system" > ‚ùå "the system"
- ‚úÖ "soil microbiome" > ‚ùå "microorganisms"

**Instruction**: When you encounter generic references ("the land", "the process", "the answer"), look at surrounding context to identify the specific entity being referenced. If context is insufficient, skip the relationship rather than extract a vague entity.

## üìö CONTENT TYPE HANDLING

### Content Type Recognition
Distinguish between different types of content to extract appropriately:

**ENDORSEMENT QUOTES**: Praise from reviewers, typically in foreword or back cover
**FACTUAL CONTENT**: Main text describing concepts, processes, or relationships
**AUTHOR CLAIMS**: Author's own statements about their work

### Handling Rules by Content Type

#### From ENDORSEMENT QUOTES:
‚úÖ **Extract ONLY**: (Reviewer, endorsed, Book) relationships
‚ùå **DO NOT extract**: Content claims from praise language
‚ùå **DO NOT extract**: Metaphorical 'is-a' from praise ('is a compass', 'is a road-map', 'is a guide')
‚ùå **DO NOT extract**: Functional claims from promotional language ('this book nourishes soil', 'helps heal the planet')

**Rationale**: Endorsement quotes are promotional opinions, not factual content. They tell us WHO endorsed WHAT, but not factual information about the subject matter.

#### From FACTUAL CONTENT:
‚úÖ **Extract**: All relevant relationships normally following all extraction rules

#### From AUTHOR CLAIMS:
‚úÖ **Extract**: But mark as author's perspective if subjective

### Detection Guidance

**Endorsement Markers**:
- Phrases: "I recommend", "This book is", "I highly encourage", "A must-read"
- Praise adjectives: "wonderful", "essential", "invaluable", "brilliant"
- Reviewer attribution: "‚Äî Name, Title/Organization"
- Recommendation language: "should read", "will benefit from"

**Location Indicators**:
- First 2-3 pages (foreword, introduction)
- Last pages (back matter, praise section)
- Quotation blocks with attribution

**Tone Indicators**:
- Promotional, laudatory, recommendation-focused
- Second-person address ("you will find")
- Superlatives and emphatic language

### Examples

#### ‚ùå WRONG Extractions from Endorsements:
- From "This handbook nourishes the soil" ‚Üí ‚ùå (Handbook, nourishes, soil)
- From "This book is a compass for change" ‚Üí ‚ùå (Book, is-a, compass)
- From "Helps heal the planet" ‚Üí ‚ùå (Book, helps heal, planet)
- From "A road-map to regeneration" ‚Üí ‚ùå (Book, is-a, road-map)

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Extractions from Endorsements:
- From "This handbook nourishes the soil ‚Äî Brigitte Mars" ‚Üí ‚úÖ (Brigitte Mars, endorsed, Handbook)
- From "This book is a compass for change ‚Äî Joel Salatin" ‚Üí ‚úÖ (Joel Salatin, endorsed, Book)
- From "I highly recommend this work ‚Äî Dr. Elaine Ingham" ‚Üí ‚úÖ (Dr. Elaine Ingham, endorsed, Book)

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Extractions from Factual Content:
- From main text: "Compost nourishes soil by adding organic matter" ‚Üí ‚úÖ (compost, nourishes, soil by adding organic matter)
- From main text: "This method serves as a guide for farmers" ‚Üí ‚úÖ (method, guides, farmers)
- From main text: "Cover crops help heal degraded soil" ‚Üí ‚úÖ (cover crops, help heal, degraded soil)

### Decision Framework for Content Type:

1. **Is this in a foreword, introduction, or praise section?** ‚Üí Likely ENDORSEMENT
2. **Does it contain recommendation language or praise?** ‚Üí Likely ENDORSEMENT
3. **Is there reviewer attribution?** ‚Üí Definitely ENDORSEMENT
4. **Is this describing how something works or what it contains?** ‚Üí FACTUAL CONTENT
5. **Is the author making claims about their own work?** ‚Üí AUTHOR CLAIMS

**When in doubt**: If the statement sounds promotional or laudatory, treat as endorsement and extract ONLY the endorsement relationship.

## ‚úÖ V11: EXTRACT ALL STATEMENT TYPES (They will be labeled)

Extract ALL relationships including philosophical, normative, and metaphorical statements. They will be properly classified in Pass 2 with flags like:
- FACTUAL (verifiable facts)
- METAPHOR (figurative language)
- PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM (essence claims, value judgments)
- TESTABLE_CLAIM (empirical assertions)

The postprocessing pipeline (Pass 2.5) will then handle these appropriately:
- Metaphors: Normalized by FigurativeLanguageFilter
- Philosophical claims: Labeled and flagged
- All relationships: Properly categorized

**Patterns to Extract and Label** (V11 NEW):
- ‚úÖ Philosophical essence claims: 'X is what it means to be Y' ‚Üí Will be labeled PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM
- ‚úÖ Normative prescriptions: 'we should/must do X' ‚Üí Will be labeled appropriately
- ‚úÖ Metaphorical abstractions: 'X is the answer/key/solution' ‚Üí Will be labeled METAPHOR
- ‚úÖ Rhetorical constructions: 'X opens doors to Y' ‚Üí Will be labeled METAPHOR
- ‚úÖ Value judgments: 'X is beautiful/important/essential' ‚Üí Will be labeled OPINION/PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM
- ‚úÖ All factual statements: 'soil contains organic matter' ‚Üí Will be labeled FACTUAL

**Examples** (V11 - Extract ALL, labels added in Pass 2):
- ‚úÖ EXTRACT: 'being connected to land is what it means to be human' ‚Üí (being connected to land, is what it means to be, human) [Will be labeled PHILOSOPHICAL_CLAIM]
- ‚úÖ EXTRACT: 'soil is the answer' ‚Üí (soil, is, the answer) [Will be labeled METAPHOR and normalized by postprocessing]
- ‚úÖ EXTRACT: 'we must regenerate the soil' ‚Üí (we, must regenerate, soil) [Will be labeled with appropriate classification]
- ‚úÖ EXTRACT: 'soil contains organic matter' ‚Üí (soil, contains, organic matter) [Will be labeled FACTUAL]
- ‚úÖ EXTRACT: 'regenerative agriculture increases soil carbon' ‚Üí (regenerative agriculture, increases, soil carbon) [Will be labeled TESTABLE_CLAIM or FACTUAL]

## ‚úÖ V11: FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE HANDLING

Extract metaphorical statements - they will be labeled as METAPHOR in Pass 2 and normalized by the FigurativeLanguageFilter module in Pass 2.5 postprocessing.

### Common Metaphor Patterns to AVOID:
- ‚ùå 'X is a Y' where Y is figurative: Eden, paradise, crossroads, miracle, answer, key, door, journey, treasure, gold mine
- ‚ùå 'X opens doors to Y' (metaphor for enabling/opportunity)
- ‚ùå 'X is the key to Y' (metaphor for importance/solution)
- ‚ùå 'X is a journey' (metaphor for process/experience)
- ‚ùå 'X is the heart of Y' (metaphor for centrality)
- ‚ùå 'X is a bridge to Y' (metaphor for connection)
- ‚ùå 'X is the foundation of Y' (metaphor for importance) - UNLESS literally structural
- ‚ùå 'X is a window into Y' (metaphor for insight)

### Metaphor Recognition Examples:

**EXTRACT - Pure Metaphor** (V11 NEW - will be labeled METAPHOR):
- ‚úÖ "Our land is a veritable Eden" ‚Üí (our land, is, veritable Eden) [METAPHOR flag, will be normalized]
- ‚úÖ "We are at a crossroads" ‚Üí (we, are at, crossroads) [METAPHOR flag]
- ‚úÖ "Soil is the answer to climate change" ‚Üí (soil, is answer to, climate change) [METAPHOR flag]
- ‚úÖ "This opens doors to new possibilities" ‚Üí (this, opens doors to, new possibilities) [METAPHOR flag]
- ‚úÖ "Knowledge is a treasure" ‚Üí (knowledge, is, treasure) [METAPHOR flag]

**EXTRACT LITERAL - Clear Underlying Fact**:
- ‚úÖ "Soil is the foundation of agriculture" ‚Üí (soil, supports, agriculture) [literal dependency]
- ‚úÖ "Trees provide oxygen" ‚Üí (trees, produce, oxygen) [literal process]
- ‚úÖ "Roots anchor plants in soil" ‚Üí (roots, anchor, plants in soil) [literal function]

**SKIP - Ambiguous/Unclear**:
- ‚ùå "Regeneration is a journey we must take together" (metaphorical framing)
- ‚ùå "This practice is the key to success" (vague metaphor)

### Decision Framework:
1. **Is the statement using figurative/poetic language?** ‚Üí SKIP
2. **Does 'X is Y' use Y as a metaphor (Eden, key, answer, journey)?** ‚Üí SKIP
3. **Can you extract a clear, testable, literal claim?** ‚Üí EXTRACT
4. **When in doubt about metaphor vs. literal?** ‚Üí SKIP (err on side of caution)
